## Flight Management System

Developed using core Java enterprise technology, the Flight Management System is an end-to-end solution for managing inbound and outbound flights at an international airport. Users can create, edit, and delete flights in a Web user interface that connects to a back-end Java application and a MySQL database. The Web interface is designed as a single-page application using Ajax and JavaScript.

· Designed a user interface and implemented using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ajax, and Bootstrap

· Integrated Java application with a relational database using JDBC and SQL
